# About

The R code and data provided in this repository allow to reproduce the
data carpentry, analysis and visualization of *“Insects decline with
host plants but co-extinctions may be limited”*.

The primary dataset used in this analysis is
`RL_inter_plant_insect-JUNE2024.csv`, which includes plant insect
interaction data and red list trends.

## R scripts

`00` loads all necessary packages

`01a and 01b` relates population trends of host plants to insects

`02a and 02b` quantifies insect co-extinctions from threatened plant
extinctions

`03` identifies foundation genera

`04` tests plant-insect network nestedness/asymmetry hypothesis

`05` produces additional supplementary analyses

`Figures` contains all figures produced in this analysis.
